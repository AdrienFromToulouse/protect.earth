Standalone and hybrid systems for [heating air and water](https://www.greenbuilt.org/articles/134-solar-heated-water-with-radiant-floor-heat/), even cooling interior spaces can help drastically reduce your carbon footprint and save you money on utility costs over time. Solar thermal water heaters can heat water from the sun anywhere in the world, even the UK, or the Arctic.

If you are remodelling your home, building a new one, or just looking to make some easy tweaks around the place, these ideas can help. Contrary to popular belief, environmentally friendly systems are not always more expensive than grid-tied systems. Thanks to a wide variety of [tax rebates](https://www.energystar.gov/rebate-finder), incentive programs, and grants, in many countries these resource efficient upgrades are accessible to folks on lower budgets.
